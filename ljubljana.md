# Life in Ljubljana

Almost exactly 2000 years ago, in 14 AD, the Roman town of Emona was established at the location of present-day Ljubljana, and you can still climb a Roman wall just a stone's throw from our department.

Today, Ljubljana is a beautiful, vibrant, and immensely livable city. In fact, it made #2 on Lonely Planet's  
Best in Europe 2014 list, and is the winner of the European Green Capital Award 2016! Our department is  
a 20-minute walk or a 10-minute bike or bus ride away from the city centre and Old Town, where you can get your fair share of culture, caf√©s, historical buildings, cobbled streets and bridges.

And best of all, Ljubljana is smack in the centre of Slovenia, one of Europe's smallest, greenest, and most geographically and biologically diverse countries. Snow-capped Alpine mountains, gorgeous glacial lakes, emerald-green rivers, limestone caves, the Mediterranean Sea, mediaeval coastal towns, the famous Lipizzaner horses, virgin forests, thermal spas, and the oldest grape vine in the world can all be easily reached by car, bus or train in an hour and a half or less!
