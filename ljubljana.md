# Life in Ljubljana

Approximately 2000 years ago, in 14 AD, the Roman town of Emona was established at the location of present-day Ljubljana, and you can still climb a Roman wall just a stone's throw from our department.

Today, Ljubljana is a beautiful, vibrant, and immensely livable city. In fact, it made #2 on Lonely Planet's Best in Europe 2014 list, was the winner of the European Green Capital Award 2016, and was voted the [best place to travel in Europe in 2022](https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/european-best-destinations-2022/)! Our department is a 20-minute walk or a 10-minute bike or bus ride away from the city centre and Old Town, where you can get your fair share of culture, cafés, historical buildings, cobbled streets and bridges.

And best of all, Ljubljana is smack in the centre of Slovenia, one of Europe's smallest, greenest, and most geographically and biologically diverse countries – it was ranked #5 on [Yale's list](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-environmentally-friendly-countries-2016-3) of world's greenest countries in 2016. Snow-capped Alpine [mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglav), gorgeous glacial [lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bled), emerald-green [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%C4%8Da), limestone [caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postojna_Cave), the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_Istria), mediaeval coastal [towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piran), the famous [Lipizzaner horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipica,_Se%C5%BEana), virgin [forests](https://www.google.com/search?q=virgin+forests+slovenia&tbm=isch), thermal [spas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa_town#Slovenia), and the oldest [grape vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_vine#Old_vines_around_the_globe) in the world can all be easily reached by car, bus or train in an hour and a half or less!
