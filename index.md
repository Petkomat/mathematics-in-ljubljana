# Mathematics in Ljubljana 2023

The summer school Mathematics in Ljubljana 2023 will take place from ??? in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The aim of the school is to introduce the most exciting areas of physics studied at research institutions in Ljubljana to curious students.

The summer school is aimed at bachelor’s and master’s degree students of physics, although students outside of this scope will be considered under reasonable motivation. The summer school will be held entirely in English. There is no registration fee and we will provide free housing and meals for participants (plus some additional surprises …).

Major topics covered:
