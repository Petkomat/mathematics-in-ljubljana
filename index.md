# Mathematics in Ljubljana 2023

Join us for a week of exciting mathematics at the summer school Mathematics in Ljubljana 2023, taking place from July 2nd to 8th, 2023 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Our goal is to introduce curious students to the most fascinating areas of mathematics studied in Ljubljana.

In addition to an overview of the local research groups, we will offer two minicourses to delve deeper into specific topics, as well as plenty of social activities to help you make connections with fellow participants.

Our summer school is designed for bachelor's and master's students of mathematics, although students outside of this scope will be considered under reasonable motivation. The summer school will be held entirely in English. 

Best of all, there's no registration fee and we are providing free housing and meals for participants. Come and explore mathematics in one of Europe's most beautiful cities. Apply now!
