# Program

The summer school will consist of 5 days (Monday to Friday). Morning will be devoted to two minicourses, namely: *Formalization of Mathematics* (given by Egbert Rijke) and *Introduction to Complex Dynamics* (given by Luka Boc Thaler). In the afternoons, research groups at the department will give a short presentation of their work and members. Research areas covered will be *Algebra, Complex Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Functional Analysis, Numerical Linear Algebra, Probability, Topology, Type Theory*.

In addition to the mathematical content, we will provide detailed information on the following topics: description of the master's and doctoral programmes (including the possibility of obtaining a double degree with the University of Trieste for master's students), details on arrival, accommodation, and study in Ljubljana, and first-hand information on living and studying in Ljubljana from existing foreign master's and doctoral students.

On the first day of the school, we will organize a guided tour of Ljubljana, and on Wednesday, we will organize an excursion to Bled. Participants will have the opportunity to visit the memorial room of the first rector of the University of Ljubljana and mathematician Josip Plemelj and learn about his life and work.

More details will follow.
